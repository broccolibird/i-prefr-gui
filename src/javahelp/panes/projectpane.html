	Cadence SMV is a symbolic model checking tool that allows you to formally verify temporal logic properties of finite state systems, such as computer hardware designs. It verifies the design for all possible input sequences.

	NuSMV is a reimplementation and extension of SMV, the first model checker based on BDDs. NuSMV has been designed to be an open architecture for model checking, which can be reliably used for the verification of industrial designs, as a core for custom verification tools, as a testbed for formal verification techniques, and applied to other research areas.
