	<p>CI-net Statements in the form {A};{B}:{C};{D} can be read as:
	<br>If I have attributes A, and I do not have attributes B, then I prefer the attributes C over the attributes D.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong>
	<br><center><img src="../pics/conditionExpressionSample.PNG"/></center>
	<br>If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>.
	
	<br>
	<H2><a name="write">Writing CI-Net Statements</a></H2>
	<p>To form a complete Conditional Importance Expression (preference), the final two fields must be filled AND each attribute may only appear once in the expression.
	<p>Example statements:
	<ul>
		<li>Using only the final two fields forms a preference:
			<ul><li>"I prefer that the car have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Using the final two fields with either the first or second field forms a conditional preference:
			<ul>
				<li>first: "If the car has <em>power windows</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li>
				<li>second: "If the car does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>All four fields can also be used at the same time:
			<ul><li>"If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
