	<br>Fill fields until you have the desired expression. See <a href="#read">Reading CI-Net Statements</a> for instruction reading Conditional Importance Expressions.

	<H2><a name="read">Reading CI-Net Statements</a></H2>
	<p>CI-net Statements in the form {A};{B}:{C};{D} can be read as:
	<br>If I have attributes A, and I do not have attributes B, then I prefer the attributes C over the attributes D.
	</p>
	<p><strong>Example:</strong>
	<br><center><img src="../pics/conditionExpressionSample.PNG"/></center>
	<br>If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>.
	</p>
	
	<H2><a name="write">Validating CI-Net Statements</a></H2>
	<p>To form a complete Conditional Importance Expression (preference), the final two fields must be filled AND each attribute may only appear once in the expression.
	To verify that an expression meets these specifications, select the <em>validate button</em> to the right of the expression.
	<p>Example statements:
	<ul>
		<li>Using only the final two fields forms a preference:
			<ul><li>"I prefer that the car have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>Using the final two fields with either the first or second field forms a conditional preference:
			<ul>
				<li>first: "If the car has <em>power windows</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li>
				<li>second: "If the car does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>All four fields can also be used at the same time:
			<ul><li>"If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br>Example invalid statements:
	<ul>
		<li>One of the final two fields are not filled:
			<ul><li>"If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <em>sun roof</em> over <strong>{?}</strong>."</li>
			<li>"If the car has <em>power windows</em>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <strong>{?}</strong> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
		<li>An attribute appears more than once in an expression:
			<ul><li>"If the car has <strong>power windows</strong>, and does not have <em>four doors</em>, then I prefer that it have a <strong>power windows</strong> over <em>power locks</em>."</li></ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
